# Examples

## Desktop notification

Per default, the script creates a desktop notification when it detects a change
in the selected region.

    change_handler()
    {
        # put commands here that are executed when a change in the pixel happens
        notify_desktop
        # play_sound
    }

## Play sound

To play a sound when the selected region changes just substitute the path to a
music file in the `play_sound` function. 

    play_sound()
    {
        check_command "cvlc"
        cvlc --play-and-exit <your-path-to-a-sound-file>.opus
    }

and uncomment the call to the function in `change_handler`

    change_handler()
    {
        # put commands here that are executed when a change in the pixel happens
        # notify_desktop
        play_sound
    }

# Customize

Modify the script to run arbitrary commands by first creating a bash function:

    my_commands()
    {
        # my commands
    }

Add the function call to the `change_handler` function

    change_handler()
    {
        # put your commands function here 
        my_commands

        # notify_desktop
        # play_sound
    }
